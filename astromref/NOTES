Create an object catalogue from an image to use as an astrometry
reference catalogue with scamp.

You need to supply an image and weight image. Edit the image and
weight names in run.sh. If you don't have a weight image, comment out
the weight options line.

sh run.sh

This creates astrefcat.cat. Filter out bad, marginal and very extended
detections with filtercat.py. (Needs pyfits to be installed!)

python filtercat.py

Now you can use the resulting file astrefcat.cat as a reference
astrometry file for scamp. you need to set  

-ASTREF_CATALOG FILE -ASTREF_BAND DEFAULT -ASTREFCAT_NAME astrefcat.cat \
-ASTREFMAG_KEY MAG_AUTO

See the astrom.scamp file for an example.
