This is a collection of scripts for reducing LBC data.  It is very
heavily based on Ben Weiner's nice collection of scripts
(http://mingus.as.arizona.edu/~bjw/software/). The main advantage of
this package is that doesn't require IDL to run; instead it uses
Python.

Please let me know if you plan to using the package so I can
help. Much of it will be difficult to understand if you try to dive in
by yourself.

In rough order of execution, the scripts do the following:

commands.sh:  Basic overview of the order in which to run commands.

sort_LBC.py: script to sort the raw LBC files into bias/flats/object
  frames.

*.cl: iraf functions for inital LBC reduction and cosmic ray removal.

clean_crrays.sh: remove all the temporary files after the IRAF cosmic
  ray rejection script is done.

prepare.py: copy all the necessary files to a directory to prepare for
  reduction.

cp_reduction_files.sh: copy the reduction files necessary to run
  lbc.py.

lbc.py: perform astrometry, resampling and image combinations with
  scamp and swarp, one chip at a time.

run.sh: Examples of how to call lbc.py.

makeList.sh: Select which exposures should be grouped to make the
  co-added image.

conf/: Sextractor, scamp and swarp configuration files.

astromref/: configuration files and scripts necessary for making an
  astrometry reference catalogue from an image using Sextractor. This
  should not be necessary with LBC, USNO or SDSS stars in my
  experience allow a good enough solution to be found.
